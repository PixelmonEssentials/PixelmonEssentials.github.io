                <p><b>Are you going to port this to Pixelmon Generations/Pure Pixelmon Reforged?</b></p>
                <p>I have no interest in porting this for other versions of pixelmon/removing the Custom NPCs dependency. Pixelmon Essentials was made for my personal projects, and figured that some of the tools used for it could be useful to other people. If someone wants to make a port, they're more than welcome to, but I don't want to be that someone.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>How frequently is this going to be updated?</b></p>
                <p>I have no clue. While I hope I won't have to do much of those, I'm going to release bug fixes as quickly as I can. When it comes to new features though, Pixelmon Essentials isn't a high priority for me, as I consider my other projects more important. If I end up working on something that will make sense adding here, I will do so.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>I found a bug! How do I report it?</b></p>
				<p>Either report it in the Pixelmon Essentials discord, or start a new issue ticket on the project's Github page. I'll try to fix it as soon as I have some time.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Is this an official sidemod for Pixelmon/Custom NPCs?</b></p>
                <p>I'm not affiliated with either with the mods, I'm just a fan of both. I have contributed to Custom NPCs, but this is something done indepently.</p>
